		This document is a report on the progress and findings of a dissertation to implement a 2D pen plotter using safety critical design and implementation techniques. This project is split into 4 major sections. The conversion of DXF files into GCODE, the conversion of rasterized images (such as a PNG file) into GCODE, a robot control system simulator and a robust GUI for controlling the entire system. 
		
		This project will require rigorous testing, multiple fail-safes and emergency stop buttons for each section in order to produce a safe and reliable product. In order to ensure this is all complete on time, a strict time schedule will be required. This will be maintained by using a modified version of scrumban, where the idea of sprints will be implemented along side the time management systems of kanban. This will need to be modified as scrumban is usually used for a team of developers, whereas this will be a solo project.
